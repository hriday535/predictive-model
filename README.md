logistics regression using Sas

Project Description: Using credit screening dataset to understand factors that impact eligibility for a personal loan, based on historical data and their default behavior on loan taken. Attributes are credit history, employee tenure, job category and good_bad.

Action and deliverables:
•	Import data onto Sas
•	Data exploration and preparation
•	Run proc logistic on data import
•	Interpret the key statistics we get in table as output after running proc logistics reg such as model information , number of observation, response profile, convergence status, model fit statistics, testing global null hypothesis, parameter estimates, odds ratio estimates, concordance table, hosmer and lemeshow
•	Run logistic for predicted probability
•	Assessment of model performance by lift curve/gain chart, rank ordering, classification table/ROC curve and scoring
